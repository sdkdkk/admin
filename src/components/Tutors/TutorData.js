        Answer: "For this, task, the users can simply proceed with the navigator.app string. The string performs this task automatically and the user just needs to define it at the right time. ALast 14hlso, the users need to make sure that the instructions are executed in the right manner. Sometimes there is a need to define the IP or other address of the server that needs to be detected.

        Answer: "Well, there are a few differences that separate both these terms from each other.Basically, JavaScript is a modified version or a coded version that is generally considered in the HTML pages while on the other side, Java is a well- known programming language used to develop applications in almost every category.Both these languages don’t depend on each other for their task and have separate applications.Generally, Java is considered an an OOPS language while JavaScript is a scripting language preferred by the clients.Also, JavaScript has wide applications in HTML WebPages while Java is used mostly in developing computer applications.",

        Question: " Compare ASP Script and JavaScript in terms of speed ?",
        Answer: " When it comes to speed, both of them are powerful but both have their own limits that put them separate from one another. JavaScript is known to have a quick speed for performing similar functions. This is because JavaScript doesn’t need the help of a web server to perform the task which is assigned to it. However, ASP is slow as compared to it. This is because of the very same reason and i.e. it depends largely on the webserver for executing the tasks assigned to it. Although the server-side version of JavaScript i.e. node.js also exists, still it is known to provide quick results.",

        Question: " In JavaScript, which method you will find similar to the pop method? ",
        Answer: "  TThe Pop method is very much similar to the shift method but there are some noticeable differences. In the pop method, the last element of the defined array is taken generally, and then the same is returned. This often cut down the size of the array. On the other side, the Shift method generally considers the first element of the array or any other element in the beginning. ",
